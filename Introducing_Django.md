<strong>Introducing Django</strong>

This is a short introduction to the Django framework. Django is a web development framework written in Python, and its aim is to be versatile. It's capable of building any application you might envision, but it's also performant and convenient. You'll build applications quickly, and they'll run quickly as well. Now, Django is also a very complete framework. Out of the books, it contains everything you need to build any web application. It has its own HTML template language, a beautiful ORM framework for storing your data in a database, sessions, authentication, internationalization, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

Now, what I want to focus on are the various components that make up a Django application. Mainly, the following three types of components: models, templates, and views. And these three types of components together make up the architecture that's central to Django, which is aptly called model template view, or MTV, for short.
